<h4 class="title-section">FAQ</h4>
            <div class="answers">
              <h5 id="a1">When will the BLOCKv crowdsale start?</h5>
              <p>The crowdsale will start on October 12, at 9am EDT.</p>
<h5 id="a2">Where and how will the BLOCKv crowdsale take place?</h5>
              <p>The crowdsale will happen through a widget that will appear on https://blockv.io/ when the crowdsale starts on October 12,
                at 9am EDT.</p>
<h5 id="a3">How to participate in the BLOCKv Crowdsale?</h5>
              <p>To participate in the crowdsale, you will have to have ERC20 compatible wallet you fully control. Please make sure that this
                is your wallet, and not one owned by an exchange or any other intermediary. Please make sure that it is indeed the wallet
                that supports custom ERC20 tokens. You can contribute in BTC or ETH to buy tokens during crowdsale.</p>
<h5 id="a4">Is there a minimum or maximum of VEE tokens I can buy during the general sale?</h5>
              <p>There is no maximum amount of VEE tokens per purchase, the only limitation is amount of VEE tokens available to the crowdsale.
                We want to achieve broad distribution and consequently we do not restrict minimal amount.</p>
<h5 id="a5">Which payment methods will be accepted in the crowdsale?</h5>
              <p>Bitcoin (“BTC”) and Ethereum (“ETH”) will be the only methods of payment accepted in the crowdsale.</p>
<h5 id="a6">What is the pricing mechanism?</h5>
              <p>The price of VEE token will be nominated in USD. The FX rates for BTC/USD and ETH/USD will be fixed 1 hours before the main
                sale starts. BLOCKV will accept funds for 5 days with a hardcap of $20MM for the crowdsale. 1 billion tokens will be available
                for the crowdsale.</p>
<h5 id="a7">How will I know if my purchase was successful? Both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks are overloaded.</h5>
              <p>For purchases made in BTC and ETH, we will deem a purchase to be successful when three confirmations have been received within
                six hours of the time that payment information is displayed to you during the crowdsale process. We reserve the right to
                refund your purchase if the transaction is processed after the six hour period lapses.</p>
<h5 id="a8">How to participate in Pre-sale?</h5>
              <p>Minimum amount for the pre-sale is $50 000, please address your requests to presale@blockv.io</p>
<h5 id="a9">How many VEE tokens will be available in the crowdsale and how many created in total?</h5>
              <p>This depends on the amount of funds that will be gathered during the token sale. Please find more information in the whitepaper.</p>
<h5 id="a10">Are there any bonuses or discounts available for this crowdsale?</h5>
              <p>Yes, there is a presale discount available. Up to 20% discount is available to presalers.</p>
<h5 id="a11">Where can I read the BLOCKv whitepaper in full?</h5>
              <p>The whitepaper is available at https://blockv.io/</p>
<h5 id="a12">Will there be a lock-up on tokens sold in the token sale?</h5>
              <p>No, there will be no lock-up for any of the tokens purchased in crowdsale.</p>
<h5 id="a13">Which wallets can I use?</h5>
              <p>If you choose to purchase tokens with BTC, you must send BTC from a wallet you control, but need to provide us with a token
                receipt address that is ERC20 compatible (see the list of ERC20 compatible wallets below). Please make sure you DO NOT
                send funds from the exchange (Poloniex, Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini etc). If you choose to purchase tokens with ETH, the ETH
                must be send from a wallet you control.</p>
<h5 id="a14">I sent from a wallet and I have the private key, can I still get my tokens?</h5>
              <p>Yes, see the instructions.</p>
<h5 id="a15">I sent from a wallet and I do not have the private key, can I still get my tokens?</h5>
              <p>If this happens, please contact tokensale@blockv.io as soon as possible. However, blockV is not responsible for any delays,
                losses, costs, expenses, or other issues relating to or arising from the loss of your private key or any other access credentials.</p>
<h5 id="a16">My token receiving address does not support ERC20 and I do not have the private key?</h5>

                any request for corrections after five days. Please email tokensale@blockv.io with all information regarding your payment
                including transaction id, email, and name.</p>
